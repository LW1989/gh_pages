Hey there! I'm Lutz, a data scientist with a twist. I started out peering into brains (quite literally – I have a PhD in Neuroscience), but these days I'm more likely to be found diving into political data sets.
My journey from lab coats to laptops taught me one thing: whether it's neurons firing or voters deciding, patterns emerge if you know how to look. I've swapped microscopes for machine learning models, and now I use my skills to make sense of the political world.
Currently, I'm crunching numbers at Aldi Süd (yes, the supermarket chain – turns out they have a lot of data too!). But my real passion? Using data science to shed light on political processes. Think election forecasting with a Bayesian twist, or analyzing political speeches with AI that can read between the lines.
